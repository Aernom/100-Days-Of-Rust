# Introduction
Welcome to the 100 Days of Rust Coding Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you learn and improve your Rust programming skills over the course of 100 days.

Each day, you will tackle a new Rust programming concept, project, or problem. You will learn about ownership and borrowing, concurrency and parallelism, the Rust standard library, web development with Rust, game development with Rust, machine learning in Rust, system programming in Rust, cryptography in Rust, and blockchain development in Rust.

This challenge is suitable for Rust beginners and intermediate learners who want to improve their skills and build practical projects. It is also a great opportunity to connect with other Rust learners and share knowledge and experiences.

We hope you find this challenge fun and rewarding, and we can't wait to see what you build with Rust!
